Creating Simulated Ices Spectra
===============================


Summary:
********

Creating a simulated spectrum can be divided into 3 steps:



Simulated spectra are created based on the following equations and ice absorption parameter and profile sets:

.. math:: "I_{obs}(\lambda)\ =\ I_0(\lambda)\ e^{-\tau(\lambda)}"

with $I_0$ the incident radiation (e.g., from background star, YSO, ...),
 $I_{obs}$ the radiation measured by the observer, and $\tau$ the optical
 depth along the line of sight to the background source.
 
 For the simulation, we start out creating a tau spectrum that contains all components that make up a real 
 ices absorption spectrum. These components include the ice absorptions and other emission and absorption features 
 including emission lines, PAH features, the scattering peak near 4.2 :math:`{\mu} m`
